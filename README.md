Our app allows users to input their mood and/or preferred genre to generate a playlist from our database of songs. 

IOS Requirements:
We used NSLayoutConstraint to position all of our app functions.

Our playlist is displayed in a UITableView

Our app has five screens and we used UINavigationController to navigate through them.

Our app has integrated with an API written by our backend members.


Backend Requirements:



Please note is that if there are no songs in the database that belong to an input category, the final playlist will be empty.
